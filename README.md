# RPG-Game

This was a tough game to make and fun. The theme is major video game titles with respecting main heroes or villians. I used gif instead of jpg images to make the asthetic more interesting.

The current game is incomplete and I will be working on this project on the side. It is challenging, but I love to make my own rpg game and this project will be improved upon.
